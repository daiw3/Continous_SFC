# Continous_SFC

This is the analysis scripts of the manuscript Heritability and Genetic Contribution Analysis of Structural-Functional Coupling in Human Brain. All data is created randomly for demonstration purpose.

## Requirments
Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA):https://yanglab.westlake.edu.cn/software/gcta/
ldsc: https://github.com/bulik/ldsc

## Usage
1. At your terminal, run heritability_demo.sh to get the heritability estimation
2. At your terminal, run gwas_demo.sh to get the GWAS output
3. At your terminal, run genetic_correlation_among_coupling.sh to get the pairwise genetic correlation between two SC-FC coupling traits.
4. At your terminal, run genetic_correlation_complext_traits.sh to get the genetic correlation between a SC-FC coupling trait and a complex trait.
